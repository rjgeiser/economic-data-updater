OSHA has preliminarily determined that the proposed revisions to the HCS will reduce costs and burdens while also improving the quality and consistency of information provided to employers and employees regarding chemical hazards and associated protective measures. Consistent with the Executive order entitled \"Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review\" (January 18, 2011) and section 3(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, which call for assessment and, where appropriate, modification and improvement of existing rules to minimize any significant economic impact upon a substantial number of small entities, OSHA has reviewed the existing HCS. The agency has preliminarily determined that the proposed revisions will enhance the effectiveness of the HCS by ensuring employees are appropriately apprised of the chemical hazards to which they may be exposed, thus reducing the incidence of chemical-related occupational illnesses and injuries. The proposed modifications to the standard include revised criteria for classification of certain health and physical hazards, revised provisions for updating labels, new labeling provisions for small containers, technical amendments related to the contents of safety data sheets (SDSs), and related revisions to definitions of terms used in the standard.",

    "Description": "We are proposing to revise the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment systems (IPPS) for operating and capital-related costs of acute care hospitals to implement changes arising from our continuing experience with these systems for FY 2022 and to implement certain recent legislation. In addition, we are proposing to rebase and revise the hospital market baskets for acute care hospitals, update the labor-related share, and provide the market basket update that would apply to the rate-of-increase limits for certain hospitals excluded from the IPPS that are paid on a reasonable cost basis, subject to these limits for FY 2022. We are also proposing policies relating to Medicare graduate medical education (GME) for teaching hospitals to implement certain recent legislation. The proposed rule would also update the payment policies and the annual payment rates for the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) for inpatient hospital services provided by long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) for FY 2022. In this FY 2022 IPPS/LTCH PPS proposed rule, we are proposing to extend New COVID-19 Treatments Add-on Payment (NCTAP) for certain eligible products through the end of the fiscal year in which the PHE ends and to discontinue the NCTAP for discharges on or after October 1, 2021 for a product that is approved for new technology add-on payments beginning FY 2022. We are also proposing to repeal the collection of market-based rate information on the Medicare cost report and the market-based MS- DRG relative weight methodology, as finalized in the FY 2021 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule. We are proposing to establish new requirements and revise existing requirements for eligible hospitals and critical access hospitals (CAHs) participating in the Medicare Promoting Interoperability Program. We are also providing estimated and newly established performance standards for the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) Program, and proposing updated policies for the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program, Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting (IQR) Program, Hospital VBP Program, Hospital-Acquired Condition (HAC) Reduction Program, and the PPS-Exempt Cancer Hospital Reporting (PCHQR) Program, and the Long-Term Care Hospital Quality Reporting Program (LTCH QRP). Additionally, due to the impact of the COVID-19 PHE on measure data used in our value-based purchasing programs, we are proposing to suppress several measures in the Hospital VBP, HAC Reduction, and Hospital Readmissions Reduction Programs. In connection with our measure suppression proposals for the FY 2022 Hospital VBP Program, we are also proposing to revise the scoring and payment methodology for the FY 2022 program year such that hospitals will not be scored using quality measure data that are distorted by the effects of the COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE) and will not receive Total Performance Scores or adjustments to their payments as a result. Similarly, we are proposing to suppress affected measures for the FY 2022 HAC Reduction Program such that hospitals will not be scored using distorted quality measure data and will not receive Total HAC Scores based on those data. For the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program, we are proposing to suppress one affected measure under the proposed measure suppression policy for the FY 2023 applicable period such that hospitals will not be assessed using distorted quality measure data and will not receive payment reductions based on those data. In addition, we are proposing to change, clarify, and codify Medicare organ acquisition payment policies relative to organ procurement organizations (OPOs), transplant hospitals, and donor community hospitals. Also, we are proposing to add regulation requiring that state Medicaid agencies accept valid enrollments from all Medicare-enrolled providers and suppliers for purposes of processing claims for Medicare cost-sharing liability for services furnished to Medicare-Medicaid dually eligible individuals in order to alleviate a long-standing problem related to claiming Medicare bad debt. Additionally, we are proposing to amend the Medicare Shared Savings Program regulations to allow eligible accountable care organizations (ACOs) participating in the BASIC track's glide path the opportunity to maintain their current level of participation for performance year (PY) 2022.",

In particular, the final rule would require health centers to create and sustain new practices necessary to determine patients' eligibility to receive certain drugs at or below the discounted price paid by the health center or subgrantees under the 340B Program, resulting in reduced resources available to support critical services to their patients--including those who use insulin and injectable epinephrine. These challenges would be significantly exacerbated by the multitude of demands on health centers related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In addition, this rulemaking proposes to update requirements for the ESRD Quality Incentive Program (QIP), including a proposed measure suppression policy for the duration of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) public health emergency (PHE) and as well as proposals to suppress individual ESRD QIP measures under that proposed measure suppression policy. This proposed rule also announces an extension of time for facilities to report September through December 2020 ESRD QIP data under our Extraordinary Circumstances Exception (ECE) policy due to CMS operational issues, and proposes to not score facilities or reduce payment to any facility in PY 2022. In addition, this proposed rule includes requests for information on topics that are relevant to the ESRD QIP. Further, this rule also proposes changes to the ESRD Treatment Choices (ETC) Model, which is a mandatory payment model that is focused on encouraging greater use of home dialysis and kidney transplants, to reduce Medicare expenditures while preserving or enhancing the quality of care furnished to Medicare beneficiaries. Finally, this proposed rule includes several requests for information to inform payment reform under the ESRD PPS.",

The Executive order states that the Federal Government's procurement interests in economy and efficiency are promoted when the Federal Government contracts with sources that adequately compensate their workers. The Executive order therefore seeks to raise the hourly minimum wage paid by those contractors to workers performing work on or in connection with covered Federal contracts to $15.00 per hour, beginning January 30, 2022; and beginning January 1, 2023, and annually thereafter, an amount determined by the Secretary of Labor (Secretary). The Executive order directs the Secretary to issue regulations by November 24, 2021, consistent with applicable law, to implement the order's requirements. This proposed rule therefore establishes standards and procedures for implementing and enforcing the minimum wage protections of the Executive order. As required by the order, the proposed rule incorporates to the extent practicable existing definitions, principles, procedures, remedies, and enforcement processes under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, the Service Contract Act, the Davis-Bacon Act, and the Executive order of February 12, 2014, entitled \"Establishing a Minimum Wage for Contractors,\" as well as the regulations issued to implement that order.",

    "Description": "To implement provisions of Executive Order 14034, ``Protecting Americans' Sensitive Data from Foreign Adversaries'' (E.O. 14034), the Department of Commerce is proposing to amend its Interim Final Rule on Securing the Information and Communications Technology and Services Supply Chain (Supply Chain Rule), which was published on January 19, 2021, 86 FR 4909. Specifically, this proposed rule would amend the Supply Chain Rule to provide for additional criteria that the Secretary of Commerce (the Secretary) may consider specifically when determining whether ICTS Transactions (as defined in the Supply Chain Rule) that involve connected software applications present an undue or unacceptable risk. The rule also makes conforming changes by revising the definition of ICTS to expressly include ``connected software applications'' and adding a definition of ``connected software application'' that is consistent with that used in E.O. 14034. The Department is interested in the public's views on the additional criteria for connected software applications, including whether they should be applied to all ICTS Transaction reviews, whether there are other criteria that should be applied, and how the Secretary should apply the criteria to ICTS Transactions involving connected software applications.",

    "Description": "The Department of Labor (Department or DOL) is proposing to amend its regulations governing the certification of agricultural labor or services to be performed by temporary foreign workers in H-2A nonimmigrant status (H-2A workers). Specifically, the Department proposes to revise the methodology by which it determines the hourly Adverse Effect Wage Rates (AEWRs) for non-range occupations (i.e., all occupations other than herding and production of livestock on the range) using a combination of wage data reported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Farm Labor Survey (FLS) and the Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) survey, formerly the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) survey prior to March 31, 2021. For the vast majority of H-2A job opportunities represented by six occupations comprising the field and livestock worker (combined) wages reported by USDA, the proposed regulations will rely on the FLS to establish the AEWRs for these occupations in accordance with the methodology used by the Department for nearly all of the last 30 years. For all other occupations and to address circumstances in which the FLS does not report wage data for the field and livestock worker occupations, the Department proposes to use the OEWS survey to establish the AEWRs for each occupation. These proposed regulations are consistent with the Secretary of Labor's (Secretary) statutory responsibility to certify that the employment of H-2A workers will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of workers in the United States similarly employed. The Department believes the proposed methodology will strike a reasonable balance between the statute's competing goals of providing employers with an adequate legal supply of agricultural labor and protecting the wages and working conditions of workers in the United States similarly employed.",

These ACLs and ACTs apply to the total combined commercial and non-commercial catch of uku. As an in-season accountability measure, if NMFS projects that the total catch will reach the ACT in any given fishing year, we would close commercial and non-commercial uku fisheries in Federal waters for the remainder of the fishing year. As a post-season AM, if NMFS determines that the most recent three-year average total catch exceeded the ACL in a fishing year, we would reduce the ACL and ACT for the following fishing year by the amount of the overage. The proposed rule supports the long-term sustainability of MHI uku.",

The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) administers the Additional Protocol Regulations (APR), which implement the provisions of the Additional Protocol affecting U.S. industry and other U.S. persons engaged in certain civil nuclear fuel cycle-related activities that are not regulated by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), or its domestic Agreement States, and are not situated at certain U.S. government locations. The APR describe the requirement to report such activities to BIS, as well as the conduct of on-site activities in conjunction with IAEA complementary access to locations where such civil nuclear fuel cycle-related activities take place. This rule proposes to amend the APR to replace the existing manual reporting and processing procedures with a mandatory requirement to submit reports and other documents on-line through the Additional Protocol Reporting System (APRS). As a result of this proposed change, all persons and locations in the United States that are subject to the reporting requirements in the APR would be required to register on-line to set up an APRS account, submit reports and other documents to BIS via APRS, and maintain current user account information in APRS. This rule also proposes to amend the APR to clarify and update other requirements (e.g., by removing the provisions that address the Initial Report requirements for calendar year 2008, replacing the provisions that address Amended Report requirements, and revising the definitions of certain terms used in the APR).",

This proposed rule implements the C-21-04 fishing management measures for tropical tuna (i.e., bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus), yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares), and skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis)) in the eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO). The fishing restrictions would apply to purse seine vessels of class sizes 4-6 (carrying capacity of 182 metric tons (mt) or greater) and longline vessels greater than 24 meters (m) in overall length that fish for tropical tuna in the EPO. To implement Resolution C-21-06, which extended the previous IATTC resolution on silky shark for 2 years, NMFS is proposing for existing regulations on silky shark to continue in effect with no proposed amendments. This proposed rule is necessary for the conservation of tropical tuna stocks and silky shark in the EPO and for the United States to satisfy its obligations as a member of the IATTC.",

    "Description": "NMFS issues this proposed rule to revise regulations for the commercial individual fishing quota (IFQ) Pacific halibut (halibut) fisheries for the 2022 IFQ fishing year. This proposed rule would remove limits on the maximum amount of halibut IFQ that may be harvested by a vessel, commonly known as vessel use caps, in IFQ regulatory Areas 4A (Eastern Aleutian Islands), 4B (Central and Western Aleutian Islands), 4C (Central Bering Sea), and 4D (Eastern Bering Sea). This action is needed to provide additional flexibility to IFQ participants in 2022 to ensure allocations of halibut IFQ can be harvested by the limited number of vessels operating in these areas. This action is within the authority of the Secretary of Commerce to establish additional regulations governing the taking of halibut that are in addition to, and not in conflict with, those adopted by the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC). This action is intended to promote the goals and objectives of the IFQ Program, the Northern Pacific Halibut Act of 1982 (Halibut Act), and other applicable laws.",

There are over 18.5 million menthol cigarette smokers ages 12 and older in the United States. This proposed product standard would reduce the appeal of cigarettes, particularly to youth and young adults, and thereby decrease the likelihood that nonusers who would otherwise experiment with menthol cigarettes would progress to regular smoking. In addition, the proposed tobacco product standard would improve the health and reduce the mortality risk of current menthol cigarette smokers by decreasing cigarette consumption and increasing the likelihood of cessation. FDA is taking this action to reduce the tobacco-related death and disease associated with menthol cigarette use. The proposed standard also is expected to reduce tobacco-related health disparities and advance health equity.",

This rule proposes new unilateral export controls on four naturally occurring, dual-use biological toxins (specifically, the marine toxins brevetoxin, gonyautoxin, nodularin and palytoxin), the synthesis and collection of which BIS has identified for evaluation according to the criteria in Section 1758 of the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 (ECRA) pertaining to emerging and foundational technologies. These toxins have the potential (through either accidental or deliberate release) to cause casualties in humans or animals, degrade equipment, or damage crops or the environment. As these toxins are now capable of being more easily isolated and purified due to novel synthesis methods and equipment, the absence of export controls on such toxins could be exploited for biological weapons purposes. To address this concern, BIS proposes to amend the CCL by adding these toxins to Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) 1C351. This rule also proposes several conforming changes to the EAR to reflect the proposed addition of these marine toxins to ECCN 1C351. In addition, this document requests public comments to ensure that the scope of these proposed controls will be effective and appropriate (with respect to their potential impact on legitimate commercial or scientific applications).",

The Proclamation declares an emergency to exist and states that immediate action is needed to ensure access to a sufficient supply of solar cells and modules to assist in meeting the United States' electricity generation needs. Accordingly, the Proclamation authorizes the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) to exercise authority under section 318(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), to extend during the course of such emergency the time to perform any act. The Proclamation also authorizes the Secretary to allow the importation of certain solar cells and modules from certain Southeast Asian countries free of the collection of duties and estimated duties under the antidumping and countervailing duty laws until 24 months after the date of the Proclamation, or until the emergency is declared terminated, whichever occurs first. In accordance with the Proclamation and the authority granted to the Department of Commerce (Commerce), Commerce is issuing a proposed rule to postpone and waive the application of certain regulations, if otherwise applicable, to solar cells and modules, exported from the identified Southeast Asian countries, that are subject to certain circumvention inquiries currently before Commerce. This proposed rule would provide that, in the event of an affirmative preliminary or final determination in the circumvention inquiries, Commerce would not instruct U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to suspend liquidation of entries of these cells and modules, collect cash deposits on those entries, or apply antidumping or countervailing duties to those entries, so long as the entries of the cells or modules were entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption before June 6, 2024 or before the date the emergency has terminated, whichever occurs first (in either case, the Date of Termination).",

The sanctuary also protects pieces of our Nation's history such as shipwrecks and other archeological resources. This proposed rule follows NOAA's publication of a draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) in August 2019, also referred to as the Restoration Blueprint, which included a range of alternatives. The proposed rule is necessary to improve the condition of resources in the Florida Keys through a series of regulatory measures designed to reduce threats and, where appropriate, restore coral reefs, seagrasses, and other important habitats.

The proposed rule would: (1) modify the spatial and temporal boundaries of current speed restriction areas referred to as Seasonal Management Areas (SMAs), (2) include most vessels greater than or equal to 35 ft (10.7 m) and less than 65 ft (19.8 m) in length in the size class subject to speed restriction, (3) create a Dynamic Speed Zone framework to implement mandatory speed restrictions when whales are known to be present outside active SMAs, and (4) update the speed rule's safety deviation provision. Changes to the speed regulations are proposed to reduce vessel strike risk based on a coast-wide collision mortality risk assessment and updated information on right whale distribution, vessel traffic patterns, and vessel strike mortality and serious injury events. Changes to the existing vessel speed regulation are essential to stabilize the ongoing right whale population decline and prevent the species' extinction.",

Also, the USPTO proposes to defer to state bars regarding fee sharing between practitioners and non-practitioners to reduce the potential for conflicts between USPTO and state bar rules.

NMFS must classify each commercial fishery on the LOF into one of three categories under the MMPA based upon the level of mortality and serious injury of marine mammals that occurs incidental to each fishery. The classification of a fishery on the LOF determines whether participants in that fishery are subject to certain provisions of the MMPA, such as registration, observer coverage, and take reduction plan (TRP) requirements.",

    "Description": "This proposed rule would modify existing limits on fishing effort by U.S. purse seine vessels in the U.S. exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and on the high seas between the latitudes of 20[deg] N and 20[deg] S, in the area of application of the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (Convention). In addition, this proposed rule would adjust the 2022 bigeye tuna catch limit in the area of application of the Convention (Convention Area) for U.S. longline commercial fishing vessels to 3,358 metric tons (mt), due to an overage of the 2021 catch limit. The proposed rule would clarify that adjustments to the purse seine fishing effort limits or longline bigeye tuna catch limits could occur each year, due to any overage of the prior year's limit. This proposed rule would also modify the following: the process for closing the fishery once NMFS expects the effort limits will be reached; the process for obtaining daily purse seine fishing effort reports; and the process for adjusting established annual catch and effort limits in the Convention Area. This action is necessary for the United States to implement provisions of a conservation and management measure adopted by the Commission for the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPFC or Commission) and to satisfy the obligations of the United States under the Convention, to which it is a Contracting Party. NMFS is seeking comments on this proposed rule and will respond to those comments in a subsequent final rule.",

If approved, Amendment 123 would amend regulations governing Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) (halibut) prohibited species catch (PSC), or bycatch, limits in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) to link the halibut PSC limit for the Amendment 80 commercial groundfish trawl fleet in the BSAI groundfish fisheries to halibut abundance. This action is necessary to comply with the requirements of the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act). In particular, National Standard 9 and National Standard 1 require fishery management plans to minimize halibut PSC to the extent practicable while achieving optimum yield in the BSAI groundfish fisheries on a continuing basis. Further, National Standard 4 requires fishery management plans to ensure that when it becomes necessary to allocate or assign fishing privileges among various U.S. fishermen, such allocation shall be fair and equitable, reasonably calculated to promote conservation, and carried out in such manner that no particular individual, corporation, or other entity acquires an excessive share of such privileges. National Standard 8 requires that conservation and management measures take into account the importance of fishery resources to fishing communities by utilizing economic and social data that are based upon the best scientific information available in order to provide for the sustained participation of such communities and, to the extent practicable, minimize adverse economic impacts on such communities. Amendment 123 is intended to promote the goals and objectives of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the BSAI FMP, and other applicable laws.",

Section 773(e) of the Act provides for Commerce to address, in its antidumping calculations, the existence of a particular market situation (PMS), such that the cost of materials and fabrication do not accurately reflect the cost of production in the ordinary course of trade. Commerce seeks public comments as it considers revisiting its PMS methodology and issuing a new regulation that would identify information that Commerce should take into consideration and should not take into consideration in determining whether a PMS exists that distorts the cost of production. Commerce also seeks comments as it considers adjustments to calculations when the amount of distortion in the cost of production caused by a PMS cannot be quantified based on the record before it.",

Based on its experience since the last revision of the Program in 2006, the Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) has identified certain changes that will both simplify and expand the original VFC Program, thereby making the Program easier for, and more useful to, employers and others who wish to avail themselves of the relief provided by the Program. Specifically, the Program amendments add a self-correction feature, clarify some existing transactions eligible for correction under the Program, expand the scope of other transactions currently eligible for correction, and simplify certain administrative or procedural requirements for participation in and correction of transactions under the VFC Program.",

    "Description": "NMFS proposes regulations to implement Amendment 123 to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Management Area (BSAI). If approved, the proposed rule would amend regulations governing limits on Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) (halibut) prohibited species catch (PSC), or bycatch, in the BSAI. Namely, the proposed amendment would link the halibut PSC limit to halibut abundance for the Amendment 80 commercial groundfish trawl fleet in the BSAI groundfish fisheries. This action responds to the obligation in section 303(a)(11) of the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act) to minimize bycatch to the extent practicable, and is consistent with the Magnuson-Stevens Act national standards. This action: minimizes halibut PSC to the extent practicable under National Standard 9; ensures that the FMP will continue to achieve optimum yield in the BSAI groundfish fisheries on a continuing basis under National Standard 1; is based upon the best scientific information available under National Standard 2; to the extent it involves an allocation of fishing privileges, is fair and equitable, reasonably promotes conservation by reducing incidental halibut mortality caused by the Amendment 80 trawl fleet, and does not result in any excessive shares of fishing privileges under National Standard 4; and takes into account the importance of fishery resources to fishing communities under National Standard 8. The action is expected to provide incentives for the Amendment 80 fleet to minimize halibut mortality at all times and conserve and improve bycatch management of the halibut resource, and it may result in additional harvest opportunities in the commercial halibut fishery. This action is intended to promote the goals and objectives of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, other applicable laws, and Amendment 123 to the BSAI FMP.",

Among other things, this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) would strengthen the EFT requirement by narrowing the scope of existing waivers from the EFT mandate or requiring agencies to obtain Fiscal Service's approval to invoke certain existing waivers; provide that Treasury has the right to nullify an agency's use of a waiver if Treasury determines that application of a waiver would lead to an agency initiating an unusually large number or proportion of payments by means other than EFT; and clarify that when an agency fails to make a payment by EFT as prescribed by part 208, Treasury has authority to assess a charge to an agency. The proposed changes reflect the reality that the use of electronic payments has expanded significantly since the waivers from the EFT mandate were first published in 1998 and also seek to take advantage of Treasury's growing profile of electronic payment options, which are faster, less expensive, and safer than paper checks. Strengthening the EFT requirements as proposed in the NPRM is also consistent with Treasury's commitment to reducing check payments.",

The BiOps strongly encouraged the inclusion of the scalloped hammerhead shark Central and Southwest Atlantic Distinct Population Segment (DPS) and the oceanic whitetip shark on the list of prohibited sharks for recreational and/or commercial HMS fisheries. This proposed rule could impact all HMS permitted fishermen.",

Specifically, NMFS is proposing the 2023 directed commercial fishing periods and fishing period catch limits by vessel size class. The proposed action includes two 58-hour fishing periods for the directed commercial fishery. The first fishing period would begin at 0800 hours on June 27 and close at 1800 hours on June 29. The second fishing period would start at 0800 hours on July 11 and close at 1800 hours on July 13. Additionally, NMFS is proposing four catch limit apportionments across eight vessel size classes (A-H) for both fishing periods. These actions are intended to conserve Pacific halibut and provide fishing opportunity where available.",

Lastly, NMFS proposes to implement a cost allocation program to transition electronic monitoring sampling costs to the industry, while NMFS remains responsible for administrative costs. These proposed changes would directly impact bottom and pelagic longline fishermen who hold Atlantic HMS fishing permits, and HMS commercial fishermen who use other gear types and HMS recreational fishermen may also be indirectly impacted given the proposed changes to the existing closed areas.",

Based on the mechanism used in establishing shark quotas and related management measures from Amendment 14 to the 2006 Consolidated HMS FMP (Amendment 14), Amendment 16 would modify the acceptable biological catch (ABC) and annual catch limits (ACLs) for Atlantic sharks and the process used to account for carryover of underharvests of quotas. In the scoping document, NMFS considers changes to commercial and recreational shark management measures related to commercial and recreational quotas, management groups, retention limits, and size limits. NMFS expects to consider the comments received on the scoping document when developing Amendment 16.",

This notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) proposes changes to lower families' child care costs, which can be a significant financial strain for families and disincentivize work, training, and education. It proposes changes to improve child care provider payment rates and practices to increase parent choice for child care arrangements and help stabilize operations for participating providers. It also proposes ways for CCDF Lead Agencies to streamline eligibility and enrollment processes so families can receive child care assistance faster and so program bureaucracy is less likely to disrupt parent employment, training, and education and impede access to child care. The NPRM also includes technical and other changes to improve clarity and program implementation.",

    "Description": "The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) proposes to amend its existing standards to better protect miners against occupational exposure to respirable crystalline silica, a carcinogenic hazard, and to improve respiratory protection for all airborne hazards. MSHA has preliminarily determined that under the Agency's existing standards, miners at metal and nonmetal mines and coal mines face a risk of material impairment of health or functional capacity from exposure to respirable crystalline silica. MSHA proposes to set the permissible exposure limit of respirable crystalline silica at 50 micrograms per cubic meter of air ([micro]g/m\\3\\) for a full shift exposure, calculated as an 8-hour time-weighted average, for all miners. MSHA's proposal would also include other requirements to protect miner health, such as exposure sampling, corrective actions to be taken when miner exposure exceeds the permissible exposure limit, and medical surveillance for metal and nonmetal miners. Furthermore, the proposal would replace existing requirements for respiratory protection and incorporate by reference ASTM F3387-19 Standard Practice for Respiratory Protection. The proposed uniform approach to respirable crystalline silica occupational exposure and improved respiratory protection for all airborne hazards would significantly improve health protections for all miners and lower the risk of material impairment of health or functional capacity.",

In addition, this rulemaking proposes to clarify regulations on how EM discard data should be estimated via the video review process. This action is necessary because the current regulatory deadlines for EM service providers may be too restrictive. This action is expected to provide more flexibility, while still meeting the data collection and data quality requirements of the EM program. This action would also update and revise obsolete regulations, correct terminology, correct web addresses, and remove obsolete administrative requirements in the Pacific groundfish fishery. Some aspects of this action remove duplicative requirements for mail notifications or mail-based record- keeping and reporting, which are also undertaken electronically. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many administrative notifications and reporting requirements were moved to electronic methods; this action would revise the regulations to be consistent with current practice. This action is intended to support the overarching goal to continually monitor the Groundfish Trawl Rationalization Program for compliance with existing regulations in an economical and flexible manner while meeting the goals and objectives of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act; MSA), the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan, and other applicable laws.",

These proposed rules would also amend existing examples and add new examples on the application of the rules for NQTLs to clarify and illustrate the protections of MHPAEA. Additionally, these proposed rules would set forth the content requirements for NQTL comparative analyses and specify how plans and issuers must make these comparative analyses available to the Department of the Treasury (Treasury), the Department of Labor (DOL), and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) (collectively, the Departments), as well as to an applicable State authority, and participants, beneficiaries, and enrollees. The Departments also solicit comments on whether there are ways to improve the coverage of mental health and substance use disorder benefits through other provisions of Federal law. Finally, HHS proposes regulatory amendments to implement the sunset provision for self-funded, non-Federal governmental plan elections to opt out of compliance with MHPAEA, as adopted in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 (CAA, 2023).",

The purpose of Amendment 32 is to provide fishing access to healthy groundfish stocks for non-trawl groundfish fisheries and the directed commercial halibut fishery while still meeting the conservation objectives of the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan. NMFS also announces the availability of a draft Environmental Assessment that analyzes the potential effects of the associated proposed rule. In addition, this action proposes minor administrative regulatory revisions which would correct the name of the Cordell Bank Groundfish Conservation Area, amend the description of the Cordell Bank Groundfish Conservation Area, add new regulatory definitions for different types of fishing bait, and add new exemptions to Vessel Monitoring System reporting requirements.",

The proposed updates remove provisions that are redundant or obsolete and codify the use of certain contractual provisions that DOL has developed and deployed in recent years in order to put potential contractors on notice of these provisions and to formalize their usage. The provisions address a range of matters, including: government property, continuity of operations, system requirements, records management, telework policy for contractor personnel, submission of invoices, mandatory training for contractors, organizational conflicts of interest, and changing the scope of a contract. Proposed edits have also been made to existing language for clarity and streamlining purposes and do not change the substantive meaning of those provisions. The proposed revision will also remove provisions in the current DOLAR that are DOL internal operating procedures, which need not be published in the Code of Federal Regulations in order for them to take effect. The current DOLAR supplements the executive branch-wide Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) to address matters specific to the Department of Labor relating to its procurement of goods and services. It also includes certain rules governing private entities doing business with DOL.",

In 2021, two separate U.S. Navy vessels struck unidentified large whales on two separate occasions, one whale in June 2021 and one whale in July 2021, in waters off Southern California. The takes by vessel strike of the two whales by the U.S. Navy were covered by the existing regulations and LOAs, which authorize the U.S. Navy to take up to three large whales by serious injury or mortality by vessel strike between 2018 and 2025. The Navy reanalyzed the potential of vessel strike in the HSTT Study Area, including the recent strikes and as a result, requested two additional takes of large whales by serious injury or mortality by vessel strike for the remainder of the current regulatory period. In May 2023, a U.S. Navy vessel struck a large whale in waters off Southern California. NMFS reanalyzed the potential for vessel strike following the May 2023 strike and proposes to authorize two additional takes of large whales by serious injury or mortality by vessel strike for the remainder of the current regulatory period (two takes in addition to the three takes authorized in the current regulations). Pursuant to the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), NMFS is requesting comments on the proposed promulgation of modified regulations and associated LOAs for the Navy governing this additional incidental taking of marine mammals. NMFS will consider public comments prior to issuing any final rule and making final decisions on the issuance of the requested LOAs. Agency responses to public comments will be provided in the notice of the final decision. The Navy's activities qualify as military readiness activities pursuant to the MMPA, as amended by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 (2004 NDAA).",

The SIMP proposed rule intended to add species to SIMP pursuant to the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. In addition, the proposed rule would have amended SIMP regulations to clarify the responsibilities and definitions, and make other necessary administrative modernizations. In light of the extensive public comments received regarding the December 2022 proposed rule, NMFS has decided to conduct a comprehensive program review in order to strengthen the impact and effectiveness of SIMP. Critical aspects of that review will include better defining the problem that we are working to address and establishing clear, achievable goals through constructive engagement with our stakeholders. Comments received on the December 2022 proposed rule will also be taken into consideration as part of the review. While NMFS conducts this comprehensive review, SIMP will continue to operate in its current form, all existing requirements remain in force, and the list of priority species currently subject to SIMP requirements remains unchanged. In addition, NMFS will continue to support industry and other stakeholders in SIMP compliance during the review.",

    "Description": "This document proposes to rescind the Department of Labor's (Department or DOL) 2018 rule entitled \"Definition of Employer-- Association Health Plans\" (2018 AHP Rule). The 2018 AHP Rule establishes an alternative set of criteria from those set forth in the Department's pre-rule guidance for determining when a group or association of employers is acting \"indirectly in the interest of an employer\" under section 3(5) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) for purposes of establishing an association health plan (AHP) as a multiple employer group health plan. The 2018 AHP Rule's alternative criteria were set aside in large part by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in New York v. United States Department of Labor. The district court found the bona fide association and working owner provisions in the rule to be an unreasonable interpretation of ERISA, inconsistent with congressional intent that ERISA applies to employee benefits arising out of employment relationships. The Department, after further review of the relevant statutory language, judicial decisions, and pre-rule guidance, and further consideration of ERISA's statutory purposes and related policy goals, now proposes to rescind in full the 2018 AHP Rule in order to resolve and mitigate any uncertainty regarding the status of the standards that were set under the 2018 AHP Rule, allow for a reexamination of the criteria for a group or association of employers to be able to sponsor an AHP, and ensure that guidance being provided to the regulated community is in alignment with ERISA's text, purposes, and policies.",

The Department wants to ensure that it is striking an appropriate balance between the need to provide U.S. workers notice of available permanent job opportunities and the opportunity to apply for those job opportunities, and, where insufficient U.S. workers are available to satisfy an employer's need for permanent labor, the need to provide employers access to foreign labor through effective administration of the permanent labor certification program. Information received from the public will help inform decisions regarding whether or how to improve Schedule A and ensure that its purpose in responding to national labor shortages is more effectively met.",

    "Description": "This document contains a proposed rule that would implement the statutory prohibited transaction exemption under section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) for certain automatic portability transactions. Section 120 of the SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022 amended Code section 4975 to add a statutory exemption for the receipt of fees and compensation by an automatic portability provider for services provided in connection with an automatic portability transaction. Specifically, Code section 4975(d)(25) provides prohibited transaction relief if the conditions set forth in Code section 4975(f)(12) are met. The Department of Labor is proposing this regulation because, with certain exceptions not relevant here, section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 transfers the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to issue certain regulations, rulings, opinions, and exemptions under Code section 4975 to the Secretary of Labor. Consistent with this transfer of authority, Congress authorized and directed the Department of Labor to issue regulations under Code section 4975 to implement provisions of section 120 of the SECURE 2.0 Act.",

The Council recently set a control date of December 8, 2023. That control date, and an existing control date of June 15, 2016, may both be used to create restrictions limiting participation in the exclusive economic zone for the Federal charter vessel/headboat (for-hire) components of the recreational sectors of the coastal migratory pelagics fishery in the Atlantic, dolphin and wahoo fishery in the Atlantic, and snapper-grouper fishery in the South Atlantic. The Council is considering a future action that may affect or limit the number of participants in the fishery, and stresses that participants should locate and preserve all relevant, fishing-related documents. If such an action is developed, approved, and implemented through a Council decision and a subsequent rulemaking by NMFS, future access to the fishery after the control date would not be assured. NMFS is informing the public of the new control date, in part, to promote awareness of the potential changes to eligibility criteria for future access so as to discourage speculative entry into the Federal for-hire components of the Atlantic coastal migratory pelagics, Atlantic dolphin and wahoo, or the South Atlantic snapper- grouper fisheries, while the Council and NMFS consider whether and how access to these for-hire components should be managed.",

    "Description": "We, NMFS, have completed a comprehensive status review of seven species of giant clams (Hippopus hippopus, H. porcellanus, Tridacna derasa, T. gigas, T. mbalavuana, T. squamosa, and T. squamosina) in response to a petition to list these species as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Based on the best scientific and commercial data available, including the Status Review Report, and after taking into account efforts being made to protect these species, we have determined that H. porcellanus, T. mbalavuana, and T. squamosina are in danger of extinction throughout the entirety of their respective ranges, T. derasa and T. gigas are in danger of extinction in a significant portion of their respective ranges, and H. hippopus is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout a significant portion of its range. Therefore, we propose to list H. porcellanus, T. mbalavuana, T. squamosina, T. derasa, and T. gigas as endangered species and H. hippopus as a threatened species under the ESA. We have determined that the fluted clam, T. squamosa, is not currently in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range and is not likely to become so within the foreseeable future. Therefore, we find that T. squamosa does not meet the definition of a threatened or an endangered species under section 4(a) of the ESA. Further, we propose to exercise the discretionary authority of section 4(d) to extend the prohibitions of section 9 of the ESA to the proposed threatened species, H. hippopus. At this time, we do not propose to designate critical habitat for the three species proposed to be listed that occur within U.S. jurisdiction (H. hippopus, T. derasa, and T. gigas) because critical habitat for these species is not yet determinable. Using the authority of section 4(e) of the ESA, we also propose to list T. crocea, T. maxima, T. noae, and T. squamosa as threatened species due to the similarity of appearance of products derived from these species (e.g., meat, worked shell products, and pearls) to those derived from the six aforementioned species proposed to be listed based on their extinction risk. We propose a special rule to define activities that would and would not be prohibited with respect to these four species in order to mitigate the substantial enforcement challenge associated with this similarity of appearance concern. We solicit information to inform the final listing determination and to inform a future proposal for any determinable critical habitat.",

The amendments are intended to align with changes that are being concurrently proposed by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as a result of the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (AML Act). The proposed rule incorporates a risk assessment process in the AML/CFT program rules that requires, among other things, consideration of the national AML/ CFT Priorities published by FinCEN. The proposed rule also would add customer due diligence requirements to reflect prior amendments to FinCEN's rule and, concurrently with FinCEN, propose clarifying and other amendments to codify longstanding supervisory expectations and conform to AML Act changes.",

The proposed coverage month amendment generally would provide that, in computing a PTC, a month may be a coverage month for an individual if the amount of the premium paid, including by advance payments of the PTC (APTC), for the month for the individual's coverage is sufficient to avoid termination of the individual's coverage for that month. The proposal also would amend the existing regulations relating to the amount of enrollment premiums used in computing the taxpayer's monthly PTC if a portion of the monthly enrollment premium for a coverage month is unpaid. Finally, the proposed regulations would clarify when an individual is considered to be ineligible for coverage under a State's Basic Health Program (BHP). The proposed regulations would affect taxpayers who enroll themselves, or enroll a family member, in individual health insurance coverage through a Health Insurance Exchange (Exchange) and may be allowed a PTC for the coverage. This document also provides a notice of a public hearing on these proposed regulations.",

These proposed rules also contain separate requirements that would apply to coverage of contraceptive items that are preventive services under the Public Health Service Act. Specifically, these proposed rules would require plans and issuers to cover certain recommended over-the-counter contraceptive items without requiring a prescription and without imposing cost-sharing requirements. In addition, the proposed rules would require plans and issuers to cover certain recommended contraceptive items that are drugs and drug-led combination products without imposing cost-sharing requirements, unless a therapeutic equivalent of the drug or drug-led combination product is covered without cost sharing. Finally, this document proposes to require a disclosure pertaining to coverage and cost-sharing requirements for over-the-counter contraceptive items in plans' and issuers' Transparency in Coverage internet-based self-service tools or, if requested by the individual, on paper.

This proposed rule would maintain and extend management measures for fishing vessels targeting tropical tuna (i.e., bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus)), yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares), and skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) in the eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO). The fishing restrictions would apply to large purse seine vessels of class sizes 4-6 (i.e., vessels with a carrying capacity of 182 metric tons (mt) or greater) and longline vessels greater than 24 meters (m) in overall length that fish for tropical tuna in the EPO. This proposed rule is necessary for the conservation of tropical tuna stocks in the EPO and for the United States to satisfy its obligations as a member of the IATTC.",

The Navy reanalyzed the potential of vessel strike in the HSTT Study Area, including the recent strikes, and as a result, requested two additional takes of large whales by serious injury or mortality by vessel strike for the remainder of the current regulatory period. In May 2023, a U.S. Navy vessel struck a large whale in waters off Southern California. NMFS reanalyzed the potential for vessel strike based on new information, including the three strikes, and authorizes two additional takes of large whales by serious injury or mortality by vessel strike for the remainder of the current regulatory period (two takes in addition to the three takes authorized in the current regulations).
